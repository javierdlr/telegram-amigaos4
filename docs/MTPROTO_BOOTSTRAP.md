# MTProto Bootstrap

This branch starts the MTProto work as an isolated experimental path. It does
not replace the stable Bot API tester and does not perform Telegram user login
yet.

## Scope

Current MTProto code is offline by default:

- TL little-endian primitive writer/reader;
- TL `bytes`/`string` length and 4-byte padding handling;
- `req_pq_multi` constructor serialization sample;
- MTProto plain-message envelope sample with `auth_key_id = 0`;
- TCP abridged and intermediate transport init plus packet framing samples;
- static bootstrap DC name mapping based on Telegram web endpoint names;
- deterministic client `msg_id` generation rules;
- supervised `req_pq_multi` probe packet builder;
- `resPQ` parser with nonce validation;
- `pq` factorization tests;
- RSA public-key fingerprint selection against a known-fingerprint list;
- built-in Telegram production RSA public key material;
- `p_q_inner_data_dc` and `req_DH_params` serialization;
- MTProto RSA_PAD with AES-256-IGE and raw RSA public encryption;
- portable SHA-1 and SHA-256 primitives with known-answer tests;
- local MTProto session-state save/load skeleton.

The optional `--mtproto-req-pq-probe <host> <port>` command is a supervised
connectivity check only. It does not perform user login and it does not create
or persist an authorization key. It parses `resPQ`, validates the echoed nonce
and factors `pq`.

Run:

```text
telegram-test --mtproto-self-test
```

Expected output:

```text
mtproto dc self-test: ok
mtproto message-id self-test: ok
mtproto auth self-test: ok
mtproto rsa self-test: ok
mtproto tl self-test: ok
mtproto envelope self-test: ok
mtproto transport self-test: ok
mtproto probe self-test: ok
mtproto crypto self-test: ok
mtproto session self-test: ok
mtproto self-test: ok
```

## Design Boundary

MTProto remains separate from the Bot API path:

- no Bot API command depends on MTProto modules;
- no MTProto code performs live auth or stores real Telegram user sessions yet;
- shared network/TLS/file helpers may be reused only after Bot API regression
  tests stay green;
- target-side validation starts only after offline MTProto self-tests are stable.

## Protocol References

The bootstrap follows the official Telegram MTProto documentation:

- <https://core.telegram.org/mtproto>
- <https://core.telegram.org/mtproto/description>
- <https://core.telegram.org/mtproto/serialize>
- <https://core.telegram.org/mtproto/transports>
- <https://core.telegram.org/mtproto/auth_key>
- <https://core.telegram.org/mtproto/samples-auth_key>

Important constraints for this codebase:

- MTProto 2.0 is the target protocol version.
- Small integer-like TL values are serialized little-endian.
- Large number byte strings used by auth-key creation are big-endian payloads.
- SHA-1 is still needed during authorization-key creation.
- SHA-256 is required by MTProto 2.0 encrypted message handling.
- Static DC names are only bootstrap metadata. Full DC options must later come
  from Telegram configuration methods after the auth-key path exists.

## Next Steps

Next MTProto work should stay behind explicit self-tests:

1. add live `req_DH_params` submission behind an explicit probe command;
2. parse `server_DH_params_ok`;
3. decrypt and validate `server_DH_inner_data`;
4. only then attempt a supervised auth-key handshake.
