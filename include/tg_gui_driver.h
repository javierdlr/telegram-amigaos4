 * The GUI chat driver: the bridge that lets the chat engine feed the native
 * GUI. It implements tg_chat_driver.on_message (the seam from step 3) by
 * projecting each resolved tg_chat_message_row into a tg_gui_message appended
 * to a tg_gui_state -- instead of the console driver, which prints it. This is
 * what turns the demo GUI window into one that shows real conversation rows.
 *
 * Pure projection: no I/O, no network, host-testable. See tg_chat_engine.h
 * (tg_chat_driver / tg_chat_message_row) and tg_gui.h (tg_gui_state).
